_This is my adaptation of Ben Van Daele and Steven Van Bael work on his great Android Widget._

All the credits for all the features goes to them.

**What I already changed:**

  * Skin Android Eclair
  * Invisible update from widget ( Does not launch the app)
  * Phone button on 2X2 widget, clicking on it launch phone application.
  * Phone, SMS and update button on 2X2 widget ( Full ) Clicking on each part launch the associated application.
  * Choose a custom Background picture for the widget
  * auto APN settings ("one-click-configuration" very useful for these complicated settings)

**What I plan to change in the future:**

  * Feel free to add more ideas, I already added what I wanted...
